# pypong
Over-engineered Pong using Pygame.

Pong is a classic game where two paddles bounce a ball around.

# Why have I over-engineered this?
To learn. And apply some concepts. The game also has additional ideas such as introducing an on demand SMASH, some considerations of building ENERGY (not yet implemented) and some other interesting ideas. 

Plan to add some fun physics engines, and some interesting AIs to play against soon.
